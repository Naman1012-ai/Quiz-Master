# 🎓 Quiz Master (Professional CLI Version)

A robust, modular Command Line Interface (CLI) Quiz Application written in **C**. This project features a real-time timer, multi-user authentication, and persistent data storage across multiple subjects.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Modular Architecture:** Code is split into logical modules (`auth`, `quiz_engine`, `utils`) for better maintainability and professional structure.
* **Real-time Asynchronous Timer:** Implementation of a non-blocking countdown timer that allows for user input while the clock ticks.
* **Persistent Storage:** Uses standard File I/O to manage:
    * **Question Banks:** External `.txt` files for Math, Science, GK, CS, and English.
    * **Leaderboard:** Tracks high scores globally across all users.
    * **User History:** Stores past attempts with timestamps.
* **Defensive Programming:** Robust input validation using `fgets` and `sscanf` to prevent buffer overflows and handle invalid user inputs gracefully.
